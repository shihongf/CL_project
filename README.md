# CL_DynamicArchitecture
This project is forked from https://github.com/yifyang/CL_gem_expansion. Thanks for Yifan's contribution, we'll continue the research.
We'll make the repo public once we publish the result.

Please note that we don't upload results, data, checkpoint directory(in order to save space). Make sure you make a directory called "data", another directory called "results", another directory called "checkpoint". The data is downloaded and created by the code from https://github.com/facebookresearch/GradientEpisodicMemory/tree/master/data.<br>

run.sh is the script to run the code
